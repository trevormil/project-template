# /stacked-mr — Autonomous overnight PR stacking

A long-running, AFK, no-human-in-the-loop mode. Instead of one ticket → one PR →
wait for merge, this **stacks**: branch N+1 is cut from branch N's tip, so work
keeps flowing without ever merging to `main`. The human reviews the entire stack
(often ~20 PRs) in the morning and merges bottom-up themselves (global §8 — merge
is still human-only).

**Review is batched at the end, not per-PR.** Build the whole in-scope stack
*without* firing a review on each PR, then run **one batch review pass** that fans
out a `/code-review` per PR concurrently (each in its own worktree). This is not
"skip review" — every PR still has to hit the passing bar — it's "review the whole
stack once, in parallel, after it's built." Two reasons this beats per-PR review:

- **Speed.** A review is ~4 min. Reviewing N PRs serially is ~4·N min; running
  them concurrently at the end is ~4 min total (bounded by the slowest single PR).
- **No review-vs-build contention.** A code review mutates/inspects a checkout;
  running one while the builder is still editing the same repo contaminates the
  test checkout and produces bogus verdicts. Deferring *all* reviews until after
  the build phase removes that race entirely.

> Forge-agnostic: this doc says "PR" / `gh`, but the stacking model is identical
> on GitLab — "MR" / `glab mr create --target-branch <parent>` (resolve with
> `.claude/bin/forge`; mapping in [`.agents/forge.md`](../../../.agents/forge.md)).

## Invocation

```
/stacked-mr "work the vault + payment tickets"      # scoped to a goal
/stacked-mr                                          # work the now/next backlog in priority order
```

This is an AFK mode: **arm the Telegram bridge** (`/notify`) at kickoff and ping
at checkpoints. If the machine has no Telegram setup, run anyway but say so.

## The stacking model

```
main
 └─ 0012-vault-create        (PR #1, base: main)
     └─ 0013-vault-spend     (PR #2, base: 0012-vault-create)
         └─ 0014-payment-link (PR #3, base: 0013-vault-spend)
             └─ ...
```

- Each branch is created from the **previous branch's tip**, not `main`.
- Each PR's **base** is its parent branch, so the PR diff (and the review) is
  just that PR's own delta — clean, reviewable units.
- `gh pr create --base <parent-branch>` sets this. `/code-review` resolves the
  base from the PR, so it reviews the right delta automatically — this is also
  what makes the end-of-stack batch review attribute each finding to the owning
  PR (each review sees only that PR's incremental slice).

## Phase 1 — Build the stack (no reviews)

Work the queue ticket-by-ticket with the loop below. **Do not run `/code-review`
during this phase** — reviews are deferred to the single batch pass in Phase 2.
Keep stacking until the in-scope queue is exhausted (or a stop condition hits).

## Loop (per ticket)

1. **Pick the next ticket** — from the goal, else the backlog by horizon
   (`now`, then `next`) and priority. Skip `future` unless told. Set the ticket
   `status: in-progress`.
2. **Cut the stacked branch** from the current stack tip:
   ```bash
   parent="<previous branch, or origin/main for the first>"
   branch="<id>-<slug>"
   git switch -c "$branch" "$parent"
   ```
3. **Implement TDD-first** — write the failing test, then the code to pass it.
   Commit incrementally. (See the project's TDD gate in CLAUDE.md.)
4. **Sanity-check + push** — type-check/build, eyeball the diff, then
   `git push -u origin "$branch"`.
5. **Open the PR** with `--base "$parent"`:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base "$parent" --title "<ticket title>" --body "<summary + stack position + test plan>"
   ```
   Note the stack position in the body ("Stacked on #<parent-PR>. Part N of the
   <goal> stack."). Link the PR url into the ticket's `prs:`.
6. **Do NOT review here.** Ping a checkpoint via `/notify` if useful, update the
   ledger, then go straight to the next ticket. Review happens once, in Phase 2.
7. **Immediately start the next ticket on top** (step 1), branching from this
   PR's tip. No reviews are running, so the stack just keeps growing cleanly.

Keep a running ledger (in the active session doc, or a scratch note) of every
PR, its branch, its parent, and its ticket. **Refresh
`.claude/bin/status > .status.md` after each slice** so a human checking in
overnight sees current progress without reading the transcript.

> **Escape hatch:** for a genuinely trust-critical PR mid-stack (auth, money,
> data migrations) you *may* review it immediately rather than deferring — but
> that's the exception. The default is defer-and-batch.

## Context hygiene — `/compact` aggressively at checkpoints

A stacked-mr run is the second-highest-bloat surface after `/factory`: per-ticket
TDD output, push results, PR-creation bodies, then N review verdicts +
findings + diffs. Without compaction, context dies inside Phase 2 just when you
need clean recall of the verdicts.

**Rule:** the ledger, branch state, and review artifacts are all on disk
(`sessions/<id>/stacked-mr.md`, the forge, `.reviews/<pr>/`). The conversation
should never become the source of truth. Compact aggressively; re-read selectively.

Checkpoints — run `/compact` (or summarize-and-purge) at each:

1. **Every ~3–5 tickets inside Phase 1** — the per-ticket TDD output and diffs
   accumulate fast. After compacting, the ledger + `.status.md` carry the
   stack state forward.
2. **At the Phase 1 → Phase 2 boundary** — the build is done; tests/diffs from
   the build are no longer load-bearing. Only the ledger needs to survive into
   the review fan-out.
3. **After collecting all batch-review verdicts**, before handling them —
   findings/suggestions live in `.reviews/<pr>/`; keep a short per-PR verdict
   summary (approve / request-changes / blocked + counts) and drop the rest.
4. **After each fix + re-review** in the verdict-handling phase — the same
   logic applies per iteration.

Prefer **out-of-process delegation** so heavy steps never bloat the
orchestrator: each `/code-review` invocation runs in its own worktree under
`codex exec`, and the verdict is what comes back — the per-PR artifact path,
verdict, test counts, and finding counts, not the full review transcript. See
the `/factory` skill's `[2.6] Orchestrator pattern` for the full table of
delegation choices (in-process subagent / `codex exec` / `claude -p` /
worktree-spawn) and their tradeoffs; the same rules apply here.

## Phase 2 — Batch-review the whole stack

When the build phase ends (queue exhausted, or the user calls it), run **one
batch review pass** over every PR in the stack. The reviews run **concurrently**,
each in its **own worktree**, so the whole stack is reviewed in roughly the time
of a single review instead of N reviews back-to-back.

1. **Refresh the forge state once** for all PRs in the stack (so each review
   resolves the right head SHA + base). Build the review list from the ledger:
   one entry per PR with its number, branch, and parent branch.
2. **Fan out one `/code-review` per PR, in parallel, each in its own worktree.**
   A review inspects and tests a checkout — running N reviews in the *same*
   working tree corrupts git state and cross-contaminates results, so give each
   PR an isolated worktree at its branch tip:
   ```bash
   # for each PR branch in the stack (run these concurrently):
   wt="${WORKTREES_DIR:-$HOME/.worktrees}/<repo>/<branch>"
   git worktree add "$wt" "<branch>"
   ( cd "$wt" && /code-review for this PR in the background ) &
   ```
   Each review is still a normal **single-PR** review: it resolves its own base
   (the parent branch) → its incremental delta → its own per-PR artifact +
   `findings.json`/`suggestions.json`. "Batch" = the orchestration firing N of
   them at once, not a new combined-artifact format.
3. **Collect verdicts as they land** and record each in the ledger. When all
   reviews are in, you have the full stack scorecard for the morning handoff.
4. **Clean up worktrees** when reviews finish (`git worktree remove "$wt"`), or
   leave them if you'll iterate on fixes (a fix + re-review reuses the worktree).

> Mechanics note: each `/code-review` invocation is single-URL by design (one
> preflight packet, one artifact per PR). The batch is N concurrent invocations,
> not one call over N PRs. See [`.agents/code-review.md`](../../../.agents/code-review.md)
> ("Batch stacked-MR review").

## Handling review verdicts

Verdicts arrive together at the end of the batch pass. For each PR:

- **approve + tests pass + 0 medium+ findings** → that PR has hit the bar. Note
  it in the morning summary; nothing else to do.
- **request-changes / blocked** → apply the findings' fix prompts to **that PR's
  branch** (not the tip of the stack), push the fix, then **re-review just that
  PR** (a single `/code-review`, not the whole batch again). Then **restack
  children**: any branches cut from the fixed branch must be rebased onto its new
  tip so the stack stays coherent:
  ```bash
  git rebase --onto <fixed-branch> <old-parent-tip> <child-branch>
  git push --force-with-lease origin <child-branch>
  ```
  (`--force-with-lease` to a **feature** branch is allowed by the merge hook;
  never to main/master.) If a fix near the bottom of the stack restacks many
  children, re-review the affected sub-chain as a small second batch.

## Stop conditions

- Backlog queue (in-scope horizon) exhausted.
- A **true blocker** needing a human decision (ambiguous spec, a destructive or
  cost-bearing action, a design fork) → `/notify --kind=blocked` with options,
  pick a defensible default and continue if possible, else pause that line and
  move to an independent ticket.
- The user says stop / "I'm back".
- A PR can't reach passing after a reasonable number of fix cycles → mark the
  ticket `stuck`, note why, and move on (don't burn the night on one PR).

## Morning handoff

When the run ends (or the user returns), produce a **stack summary** in
dependency order:

```
Stack of N PRs (review bottom-up; merge after review):
  #1  0012-vault-create   base:main             approve   ✅ tests 9/9
  #2  0013-vault-spend     base:0012-vault-create approve   ✅ tests 12/12
  #3  0014-payment-link    base:0013-vault-spend  request-changes (1 medium) ⚠ — fix pushed, re-review running
  ...
```

Include each PR url, ticket id, base branch, and latest verdict. Flag any
`stuck` tickets and any PRs still awaiting a verdict. The human merges
bottom-up; as each merges, the next PR's base auto-retargets on GitHub (or note
where a restack is needed). **After the human finishes merging the batch, run
`/merge-sync`** to close the merged tickets and scrub their PR urls from `prs:`.

## Hard rules

1. **Never merge.** No `gh pr merge`, ever (global §8, hook-enforced). The stack
   waits for the human.
2. **Every PR gets reviewed to the bar.** approve + tests pass + 0 medium+
   findings — enforced via the **end-of-stack batch review**, not per-PR during
   the build. "Stacked" is not "unreviewed"; it's "reviewed all at once at the
   end."
3. **Force-push only to feature branches**, only for restacking, only with
   `--force-with-lease`. Never to main/master.
4. **TDD-first** on every ticket — failing test before code.
5. **No reviews during the build phase.** Reviews are batched into one
   parallelized pass after the stack is built (Phase 2) — this both speeds up
   review and avoids review-vs-build checkout contention. The lone exception is
   the trust-critical escape hatch.
6. **Batch reviews run in isolated worktrees**, one per PR, so the concurrent
   reviews don't corrupt each other's git state.
7. **One stack tip at a time.** The "current tip" is well-defined; always branch
   the next PR from it (or from a deliberate earlier point for parallel lines —
   note it in the ledger if so).

## Activity

Each stacked PR already emits `pr-opened` (via `/pr-creation`) and `pr-verdict`
(via the batch `/code-review`). Add the stack-level checkpoints:

```bash
# a true blocker needs a human decision (stop condition) → global HITL inbox:
.claude/bin/hitl "Stack blocked · <why>" "<action needed / options>"
# the whole stack is built + reviewed (morning handoff):
.claude/bin/activity task-complete "Stack complete · <N> PRs" "<X approve, Y rc>"
```

## What this is NOT

- Not a merge bot. It opens and reviews PRs; humans merge.
- Not a review skipper. The passing bar holds for every PR.
- Not for trust-critical one-offs that need human eyes mid-flight — use
  `/pr-creation` + manual `/code-review` for those.
